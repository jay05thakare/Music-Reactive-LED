# Music-Reactive-LED
A music reactive LED circuit is an electronic circuit that responds to varying sound amplitude, usually of the rhythmic melody from nearby playing music & displays the changing intensity level of the sound signal in the form of blinking LEDs. It is a common circuit usually used for decorative purposes in places such as ceremonies, clubs & advertisements. The colour of LEDs changes according to the beats of music as it goes from low to high volume. The project is a simple DIY project and can be done with a few components like an Arduino board, addressable LED strip (RGB), Arduino sound sensor, jumper wires and a breadboard. The Arduino Uno microcontroller is a small, reliable, durable, and breadboard-friendly microcontroller board based on the ATMega328 model. With a good knowledge of coding and circuit connections, weâ€™re good to go with the project!

Components used : Arduino UNO Microcontroller board Sound detection module WS2812B RGB LED Strip Jumper cables Breadboard

The project is a result of mixed contribution from the members of group and support from RNXG members too.
